# 1.	Create a Dictionary
# Create a dictionary named student with keys:
# o	"name" â†’ "Alice"
# o	"age" â†’ 20
# o	"course" â†’ "Python"
# o	Print the dictionary.
# 2.	Access Values

# o	Remove the "course" key from the dictionary using del.


student = {"name" : "Alice", "age" : 20, "course" : "Python"}
print("Student : ",student)


print("\nStudent name : ", student["name"])


student["age"] = 21 #Changing age to 21
student["city"] = "Mumbai" #Adding new key "city" with value "Mumbai"
print("\nStudent after Modification : ",student)


del student["course"]
print("\nDeleted \"course\" key from Student : ",student)


#ðŸ”¹ Part B: Dictionary Operations
# 5.	Loop Through Dictionary
# Write a loop to print each key and its value in the student dictionary.
# 6.	Check Key Existence
# o	Use in keyword to check if "name" exists in student.
# 7.	Get with Default
# o	Use get() to retrieve "grade" from the dictionary.
# Provide default value "Not Assigned".

    print(f"{key}:{value}")
