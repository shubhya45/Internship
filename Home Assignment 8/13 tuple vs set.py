# 13.	Explain (in comments or writing):
# •	When to use a tuple over a list or set
# •	When to use a set over a list or tuple


#When to use a tuple over a list or set
'''
1. Use tuples when immutability is needed
2. Means the data should be not be modified or changed after creation
3. When the data should be in ordered manner (compare to set)
4. When indexing is needed (compare to set) 
5. It can be used when the performance matters. Because of it is immutable it is faster than lists.
6. When the data security should be needed in the case of accidentle modification.

# When to use a set over a list or tuple
'''
1. When it is not necessary that data should be in order.
2. When data modification is needed.
3. When data uniqueness should be compulsary. Means no data duplication.
4. You can do data manipulation operations (Set Operations) 
like union, intersection, difference, or symmetric difference.
5. When indexing is needed.
6. We can to do membership testing, means whether the element is present in the set or not
