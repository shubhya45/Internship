# 13.	Create a string_utils.py:
# o	count_characters(s) â†’ returns character count.
# o	count_words(s) â†’ returns word count.
# o	reverse_string(s) â†’ returns the reversed version.
# o	Import and test these in main.py.

    print("Character count: ", len(s))
    
def count_words(s):
    words = s.split()
    print("Word count: ", len(words))   

def reverse_string(s):
    reversed_s = s[::-1]
    print("Reversed string: ", reversed_s)
